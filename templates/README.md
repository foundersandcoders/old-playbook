#Templates

Here you will find a number of templates for various purposes. Inside `/snippets` are a number of snippets for use in your text editor to make filling out these templates simple. Each template has an accompanying `template.example.md` file, to show how it should be used.

## Submissions
Alongside the template, provide an example of how it is used in a `.example.md` file.
If possible, include a snippet for 1+ text editors too.
Porting snippets to other text editor formats is always welcome.
